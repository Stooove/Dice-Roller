# Dice Roller
This is a readme file for my simple 2 Dice simulator.

This application is run from the console line using "python New_Dice.py" or "python3 New_Dice.py" if you have python 3 installed. It will ask "how many faces should the dice have?" and requires a user input. This input should be an integer >= 1, and should enforce that condition. After the user has input a valid integer, it will ask, "how many dice do you want to roll?" again, looking for integer >=1. The application will then output a line for dice specified in the preceding prompts. 

The other .py file, Test_New_Dice, runs unit testing on New_Dice. It inputting core values and edge cases. It tests both positively and negatively, ensuring good values pass, and error values break and are handled in the application.
