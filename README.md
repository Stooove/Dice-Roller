# Dice Roller
This is a readme file for my simple 2 Dice simulator.

if upon application launch the error: "no module named PIL" then use the ternminal to install pillow: pip3 install pillow

As programmed, this application will roll 2 dice, either 4 or 6 sided. With minimum background changes, it should be dynamic 
enough to support additional faces and additional dice if the specifications change. Additional Dice and additional faces
would require additional GUI build.
